Steps to run AnafiSimulator:
1. Replace lines 150 and 195 in AnafiSimulator.py to point to the location of the /data/ folder containing cubePointers.csv on your machine
2. Run "python3 AnafiSimulator.py" in your terminal
3. This command will update output.csv with traces containing timestamp, GPS locations, flight disance and battery level for a randomly chosen path. The flight simulor will end once the flight time exceeds 22 minutes, or the drone has less than 20% charge left. At this point, the drone will return to the randomly selected starting location and end the mission.
